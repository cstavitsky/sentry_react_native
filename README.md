## Where do I begin 

Please see [INSTALL.md](./Install.md) to get started with the setup.


## Why so many files

Please see [Steps](##what-were-the-setps-again) or go through the [first ten commits](https://github.com/sentry-demos/sentry_react_native/commits/master) (and their git log) messages in chronological order, to see the exact commands that were run, step by step, to get all the autogenertaed files we needed as we kept in mind that "junk" does not belong in an SCM system. 

Turns out react-native generates it own [.gitignore file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49099131/recommended-gitignore-for-react-native/49099219
), which is of course part of this repo, so only those [autogenerated files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48448426/why-dont-we-gitignore-ios-and-android-in-react-native ) that are required for a baseline setup and the original demo code (files) are part of this repo. So now we are at point, where one can simply clone, make a few edits and like DSN, project name, auth token and be up and running.


## Where's the "original" code

Adam worked on App.js which I took as-is from him. Plus the 2 image files in the assets dir (which are also present in [original react-native repo ]( https://github.com/sentry-demos/react-native/commit/269f58d63426065a4de67a3f22d2e774787cd996)


## What else 

It appears to me that we wanted to start fresh to create this demo. And while this was a good learning excercise as we expand our demo offering, I would like to "learn/see" how far off was the [original react-native repo ]( https://github.com/sentry-demos/react-native/commit/269f58d63426065a4de67a3f22d2e774787cd996)

Since the assets are taken from there, and that it has its own App.js, it makes me wonder that a part/whole of it should already be working. I will investigate that as time permits. 

### Update

So I took the major files from this working demo viz. package.json, package-lock.json, ios/Podfile, ios/Podfile.lock, because it is these files that make the deliverable self-contained, amongst other changes like DSN and put them on top of [original react-native repo ]( https://github.com/sentry-demos/react-native/commit/269f58d63426065a4de67a3f22d2e774787cd996) , and I am getting comile errors for both ios and android. 

At this time, I propose, we use this very repo (sentry_react_native) as the new working demo for RN stuff and forget about making them work on TOP of [original react-native repo ]( https://github.com/sentry-demos/react-native/commit/269f58d63426065a4de67a3f22d2e774787cd996) . That to me is now a hacker's or pure development exercise.

## What were the steps again

This is just the background steps to get to this repo in this state. You can simply clone and  make minimal changes to DSN key to get up and running. 

```
npx react-native init sentry_react_native (where sentry_react_native is the project name) This generates the boiler plate code for the RN app
cd sentry_react_native
git init (Turn folder into a git repo)
cd ios
Edit Podfile to remove/comment out flipper install as suggested in the comments of the file itself
pod install
``` 

Throw in your changes
```
cd ..
Make any code changes you need to such as App.js
```

Throw in Sentry SDKs
```
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android (and select you Sentry react native project )
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

Ran git commit along the way and finally pushed to this repo.
